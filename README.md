# WindNoise
Model for wind-generated noise in the ocean
Code written for MATLAB 2020a
Main code requests user input for depth and then outputs plots for Noise versus frequency and Noise versus wind speed.  The offset, frequency dependence (m), and wind dependence (n) parameters are also plotted.
Function AMCAtten.m is used to calculate the sound speed attenuation using the equation of Ainslie, M.A. and J. G. McColm, (1998)
